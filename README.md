# 🎲 Dicee Game

A simple dice game that randomly generates dice rolls for two players and determines the winner.

## 🚀 Demo
Refresh the page to roll the dice and see who wins!

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css` - Contains the styling for the game.
- `index.js` - JavaScript logic for rolling the dice and updating the page dynamically.
- `images/` - Folder containing dice images (dice1.png to dice6.png).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

## 🎲 How It Works
1. Upon refreshing the page, each player gets a random dice roll (from 1 to 6).
2. The winner is displayed at the top based on the dice values.
3. If both players roll the same number, the game results in a draw.
